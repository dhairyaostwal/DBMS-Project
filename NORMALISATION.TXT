customer table

(cust_id)+ = (multiple values for) cart_id 
[doc_id can never have multiple since many customer won't refer to doctor]
Hence 1CNF


cart table

(cart_id)+ = delivery_date and product_id(which can be multiple values) can be separated into different tables

Table 1: cart_id, delivery_date
Table 2: delivery_date, product_id
Hence 2CNF


payment table

(payment_id)+ = (multiple values for) payment_date, payment_method into different tables
Table 1: payment_id, payment_date
Table 2: payment_date, payment_method
Hence 2CNF


medicine table

(shop_id)+ = {all other}
Hence in 1CNF


products table

(product_id)+ = {all other}
Hence in 1CNF
